<p>Hi there! Welcome to my personal GitHub page! If there was one word that best describes who I am, it would be <em>curious</em>. I am like a cat, always wanting to look at what's in that shoe box, and trying to understand how the world works.</p>
<p>That being said, I think no word can encapsulate all the particularities of our personalities and no word can sum up the experiences of our lives. I am no different. I'm an engineer by training with a soft spot for visual arts. I think I’m an introvert, but my co-workers would say I’m extroverted. And even with traditional degrees from well established public and private universities, I am still learning from non-traditional schooling (coding bootcamps) and from the people around me. Nonetheless, here’s an inkling of who I am…</p>
<p>My hobbies, both past and present (note my past hobbies are denoted by an asterisk*):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cycling</li>
  <li>Running</li>
  <li>Hiking</li>
  <li>Skiing</li>
  <li>Cooking*</li>
  <li>Video Games*</li>
  <li>Dancing (mostly salsa and bachata)*</li>
  <li>Astronomy*</li>
  <li>Traveling</li>
  <li>Technology</li>
  <li>Creative Writing*</li>
  <li>Singing (Chorus)*</li>
  <li>Swimming</li>
</ul>
<p>I am originally from Houston, TX, fully born and raised in the great state of Texas. My family however is from Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico (somos Norteños). After graduating Rice University, I moved to the Pacific Northwest in 2011 to work for the Boeing Company as an aerospace structural engineer.</p>
<p>After six years working in aerospace, I was laid off from Boeing. Although initially it sucked, it did give me the motivation to try something different. I had always liked the tech industry.</p>
