<h1>Miguel's Update</h1>
<em>Sunday, July 9, 2017</em>
<p>This is my second week into Dev Bootcamp’s web developer program, and so far so good. The program itself has been relatively easy to follow, although this is not the first time I’ve dabbled into HTML or coding in general.</p>
<p>It's been an interesting month. On June 23rd, I was laid off from the Boeing Company, yet believe it or not, I felt relieved. My last position at the Boeing Company was far more stressful than what I ever experience before, and although the work was cool, I did find myself often in a thankless position caught between the needs of mechanics and the requirements we are supposed to follow. It was a good experience, but one that I rather not go through again.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, I’ve had lots of visitors come over including my mom, some family from Baja, and an uncle from Texas. For me it’s always fun to have family and friends over, and they really timed it well, keeping me company during this interesting period in my life.
</p>
<p>I haven’t necessarily had a tough time with the program at DBC, but I am sure that eventually I’ll be pushed with some tough challenges. HTML reminds me of my high school computer class where we learned about basics of website design. It’s been almost nostalgic remembering how we used to make website, and definitely fun creating my own personal GitHub page!</p>
<p>Been loving the experience so far, and look forward toward making some truly awesome looking websites in the near future!!!</p>
