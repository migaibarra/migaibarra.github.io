  <h1>Miguel's Update</h1>
  <em>Friday, July 14, 2017</em>
  <p class="page">
  This week I have been learning how to style websites with Cascading Styling Sheets (CSS), and for once, I am having trouble trying to wrap my head around the topic. It’s still all good! It is, however, very new to me, and I’ve found myself at times simply doing trail and error to see how the CSS would affect the look of my website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even with positioning, I found myself working 3-4 hours trying to get an image of a cartoon octopus centered on the screen. It was very tedious, but from what I heard from my roommate, Adam Jenkins, CSS is not exactly a developer’s primary job description so much as it is coding and writing algorithms to make sure website works properly. That made me feel better, because while I do like design and the look of a website, I think my OCD part of my brain gets super frustrated when I can’t get the nav bar aligned at the top of the page or can’t get the perfect background to show on my webpage.

  This week was also brought some sad and concerning news too about the program itself. If you didn’t hear, Dev Bootcamp is closing its doors in December after I graduate. I was shocked and scared, scared especially because I didn’t know how it would be perceived by potential employers when I have to find a job at the end of the program. However, the more I thought about it, the more thought about that old saying, “teachers open the door, you have to walk through it.” My success will really depend on how I approach the challenges and the program itself, and with their help, I cannot fail so long as I get the most of the program. Therefore, despite the sad news, I am still committed fully to the program and trying to get the most from learning at DBC.

  No doubt the coming weeks will be even more challenging, but so far so good. Next week is Ruby and my first introduction to coding!
